## Project Overview 
This project is intended to simulate a dog health record book. 
It stores and records information such as vaccination dates, vaccines administered, and the dog’s medical history


## Problem 
The problem is that physical medical record books can easily be lost and are not convenient to use. 
In addition, the information may become inaccurate due to ink fading or smudging in the book.

## Goal 
The goal of this project is to record data on a computer 
so that the records will not be lost, and the information 
can be easily accessed and verified more accurately.

## Program flow 
- The user insert pet's owner name
- The user insert pet's name.
- The user selects medical services.
- The system display your services you chosed.

## Process 
I have five dogs at home and need to take them to the clinic every year. 
I am concerned that their medical record books might be lost, so I decided to store their information on a computer.
This allows the data to be easily reviewed and eliminates concerns about losing 
the record books or unclear information caused by ink bleeding.

## What I learned  
- Recording data in code
- Systematic thinking
- Planning program execution.

## Tools 
VS Code, Online Python

## Target Users 
- My family
- Myself

## Next Steps
- Further improve the system based on more information
